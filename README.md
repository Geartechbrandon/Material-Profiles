# Material-Profiles
A repository for my work with 3D printing filament. Please keep in mind that these temperature profiles are best suited to my machine, as such they are just a starting point. If you find the settings are coming out too stringy then try lowering the temeperature. If it's not extruding at all or consistently (skipping) try raising the temperature.

Why just them temperature? Well given that a filament is essentially the same (if the manufacturer hasn't changed the recipe) and the ouput hold is the same size the only variable will be within the thermoucouple and the reading. Since, on average, a thermocouple will have an error of about 3% we can expect an error in temperature between +-10C and +-20C. Feel free to use my test object to determine your  best settings based off of mine or from scratch.

Within I intend to document my tests and settings with different materials. 
I will upload a profile in the form .ini that can be improted into CURA and the information extrated with any text editor.
